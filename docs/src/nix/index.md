# Nix

## The language fundamentals

It is very desireable to build a solid set of type signatures for the most basic operators in `nix`.

Those are:

- language syntax
- [Operations](./operations.md)
- [Builtins](./builtins.md)

> If those basic functionality from a type perspective of the language itself is clarified.
>
> this opens a whole new spectrum of possibilities like **type inference** or **type checking**.
