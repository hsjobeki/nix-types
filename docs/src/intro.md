# Introduction

ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ RFC Under construction ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

This Draft of an RFC could be the first step to improve how nix is used as a language.

Generally there are two type systems:

- __Static__
  checked during 'compile' time or development time.
  So errors can be caught while writing code.
  
  __Does not exist in nix__  
  
- __Dynamic__
    - Fails execution of code based on conditionals.
    - Used in `lib/types.nix`
    - Used in `YANTS`

## Proposal: Type hints

I propose to build a set of simple yet effective `type hints`, which would mimic `static types` instead of investing to much into the dynamic types approach,
or trying to bring static types into the dynamic nix language.

By using `type hints` many additional possibilities even for dynamically typed languages arise.

- determine whether a program would actually work or not, just by looking at the types.
- provide autocompletion on typed variable- and function-bindings.
- automatically generate good documentation directly from code.
- ...

## Dynamic type validations are still needed

As type hints cannot provide any runtime assurances it is still needed to place guards in critical places.
But instead of trying to represent a non-existent static type system the dynamic approach should transparently communicate what it really does: "Runtime validation".

## Vision

This project can be seen as a first step of possible many.
By specifying the comments and not directly integrating types
into the nix language this project stays downwards compatible
and allows an intermediate phase of validation.

In that validation phase the system can obtain feedback and corrections.
It could then be made so good, that it really represents nix's type behavior.

After that we can make a point about whether we should move forward and change the nix language so that it natively supports static types, or type annotations.

> `Static Types` could then be built from the findings of this project.
