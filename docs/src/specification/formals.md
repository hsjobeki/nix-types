# Formals

## As the doc-comment references to exactly one expression. There is only one type expression possible.
## All notations are PascalCase
##  Types MUST be chosen from the existing list

 see [primitives](./basic.md)

## Operators MUST be chosen from the existing list

 see [operators](./operators.md)

## explicit `AttrSet` and `List` keywords are PROHIBITED

See the correct usage [here](./complex.md)

## [complex types](./complex.md) MUST include their members explicitly

## explicit `Any` is PROHIBITED

Correct usage with type variables see [here](./type-variables.md)



## Allowing arbitrary values within [complex-types](./complex.md) 

is possible but requires explicit statements.


##  `Type variables` must be written in LOWERCASE to prevent confusion.


## [Type bindings](./operators.md#type-binding) it is PROHIBITED to choose names from the [reserved list](./types.md)


## Spaces between Operators are recommended
